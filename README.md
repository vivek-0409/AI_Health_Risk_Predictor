##Description:
AI-Health-Risk-Predictor is an intelligent system that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to analyse health-related data and predict potential health risks. It takes input such as age, gender, lifestyle habits (diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption), medical history, and biometric data (BMI, blood pressure, sugar levels, cholesterol, etc.) to evaluate the likelihood of various health conditions.
The system provides:
•	Risk Assessment – Predicts chances of diseases like diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, or obesity.
•	Personalized Recommendations – Suggests preventive measures such as diet improvements, exercise routines, or medical check-ups.
•	Data Visualization – Displays health trends and risk scores in an easy-to-understand dashboard.
•	Early Detection – Helps users identify risks before symptoms become severe.
